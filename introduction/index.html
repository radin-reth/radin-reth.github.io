        <br><br>
        In 2013, I got my first job as frontend Web developer at Yoolk and constantly improving skills since then. In the passing 1 year, my exploration and study committed to learn Ruby on Rails and AngularJs to help Yoolk solve business problems. I enjoy  connecting with another awesome web developers around ruby communities in Cambodia to pair programming and share knowledge.

The passing years offered me a decent opportunity to give full play to my innovativeness, insight and steadiness.
